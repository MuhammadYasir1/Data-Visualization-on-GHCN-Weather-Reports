### Visualisations on GHCN's weather data using Matplotlib to observe Temperature Variations in Ann Arbor Michigan

#### Objective :  To record high and record low temperatures by day of the year over the period 2005-2014 in Ann Arbor Michigan.
* An NOAA dataset has been stored in the file data/C2A2_data/BinnedCsvs_d400/fb441e62df2d58994928907a91895ec62c2c42e6cd075c2700843b89.csv.   
* This is the dataset to use for this assignment. Note: The data for this assignment comes from a subset of The National Centers for          Environmental Information (NCEI) Daily Global Historical Climatology Network (GHCN-Daily). 
* The GHCN-Daily is comprised of daily climate records from thousands of land surface stations across the globe.

#### The following variables were provided in the data set.

1. id : station identification code
2. date : date in YYYY-MM-DD format (e.g. 2012-01-24 = January 24, 2012)
3. element : indicator of element type
4. TMAX : Maximum temperature (tenths of degrees C)
5. TMIN : Minimum temperature (tenths of degrees C)
6. value : data value for element (tenths of degrees C)

 **Tools Used for data cleaning and plotting : Python's Modules including _Pandas_, _Matplotlib_, and _Numpy_**
